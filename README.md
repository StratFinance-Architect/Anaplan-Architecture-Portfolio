# Anaplan Architecture: L1 & L2 Implementations

### 🏗️ Overview
This repository contains structural blueprints and dashboard views from enterprise planning models built during the completion of the Anaplan Level 1 and Level 2 Model Building certifications.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Multidimensional Modeling:** Structuring Lists, Modules, and Line Items using the D.I.S.C.O. methodology.
- **Supply Chain & FP&A Logic:** Building foundational forecasting, capacity, and cost-planning calculations.
- **UX Design:** Developing clean, user-friendly dashboards for end-user data entry and executive review.

*(Note: Due to the cloud-native infrastructure of Anaplan, live models cannot be hosted externally. Screenshots of the architecture and UX are provided as proof of concept).*
